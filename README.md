# Hello, I'm Jad EL Hakim!

## About Me

I'm currently a Technical Analyst at Murex Systems, focusing on providing L1 incident response support for major incidents on proprietary software for our clients, including SaaS instances. While the configuration of monitoring systems is managed by another team, I play a proactive role in supporting the SaaS instances by actively responding to alerts and engaging with log shipping processes. This ensures that we can swiftly address and mitigate potential issues, maintaining high service reliability and client satisfaction. I also deliver L2 support for internal issues, which extends beyond mere incident response to include root cause analysis and ensuring the software's improvement and sustainability through operability-directed work.

I'm a proud graduate of the Lebanese American University, holding a degree that emphasized Java programming, among other skills. I'm also a certified CCNA (since August 2022) and am currently preparing for my CompTIA Security+ exam, scheduled for April 19th.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and am actively preparing for a career shift in this field through certifications, projects, and engaging with platforms like HackTheBox.
